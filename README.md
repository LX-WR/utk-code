# Shhhh....quiet!
UltraTuxKart is a fork of Supertuxkart, an arcade racing game, which I plan to fuck with!
I need you to keep this a secret and to NOT tell anyone, because I only want the STK community to know this exists when I'm nearly finished :}
In order to run this (possibly more demanding) game:
* You should have a dual-core CPU that's running at 1 GHz or faster.
* You'll need at least 512 MB of free VRAM (video memory).
* System memory: 1 GB
* Minimum disk space: 800 MB
* Ideally, you'll want a joystick with at least 6 buttons :}

## License
The software is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL, as in the regualr STK binaries) which can be found [`here`](/COPYING), in the same directory as this file.

## 3D coordinates
A reminder for those who are looking at the code and 3D models:

SuperTuxKart: X right, Y up, Z forwards

Blender: X right, Y forwards, Z up

The export utilities  perform the needed transformation, so in Blender you just work with the XY plane as ground, and things will appear fine in STK (using XZ as ground in the code, obviously).

Oh, wait, u want an prebuilt binary? Wait a while...
